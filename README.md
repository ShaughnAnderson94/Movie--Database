# Movie Database

Shaughn Anderson

**Design Intent** In the movie database project we were given a set of Wes Anderson movies and some details about them and then asked to make a website that helped users interact with them.

the requirmenets were as follows

1. Store the object below in a JavaScript file in your codebase
2. Render the data onto the webpage with DOM Manipulation
3. Allow the user to affect the display of the data by interacting with the webpage
4. Allow the user to update the data stored in the object by interacting with the webpage

This project was deffinetly a place where I really started to learn more about Javascript. I had to learn to think about what a block of code to do a thing would look like a lot beofore I wrote it. Using the MDN basic javascript page and the free code camp lessons on objects I first built a simple program that would look at the database and write out all the details of the movie to appropriatly labled areas of the page. Next I looked at the MDN page for input and created a search field that would when the button was clicked tell the program to display the information about the film that the user typed in. I then wrote my first javascript that minpulated syles and there for had to work with what was in my css page. I used this to make a button that when clicked would hide all search results and instead bring up a bunch of entry fields for the user to create their own entries to the database. Finally I made code that let these submisions actually go into the data base in the correct place so that new films could be added.
